# fuelstock-improved
A college project for my 3rd year in Computing and Digital Media.
This is an extension of a previous project, which involved:
- Designing and implementing a database for fuel stock management in MySQL
- Using HTML, CSS, and PHP to create a front-end for performing CRUD operations on the database

In this improved iteration of the project, it has the added functionality:
- Increased validation and constraints for the MySQL database
- Improved front-end, notably now with a login system
